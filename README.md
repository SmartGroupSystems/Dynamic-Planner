# Known Issues:

(1) __Compile Error__:

(2) __Eigen Error__:

(3) __A-star Error__:

# Description
This repository mainly contains the following modules: 

(1)```bspline_race```: This module is the trajectory optimization module, primarily responsible for backend optimization, where the ```NLopt``` optimization library is used.

(2)```grid_path_searcher```: The path search module utilizes the A-star algorithm.

(3)```mapping```: A lightweight mapping module.

(4)```uav_simulator```: A lightweight quadrotor simulator.

We referred to a significant amount of code from [Fast-Planner](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner) while writing our own code, and we express our deepest gratitude to the authors for their contributions.

# Compile
__Tested environment__: Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic


# Building Simulation Maps

__Click-map__: You can use the two built-in components of rviz to click on the map to generate static and dynamic obstacles, respectively, like this:
